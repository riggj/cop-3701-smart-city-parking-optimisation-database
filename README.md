# Smart City Parking Optimization Database

This project is dedicated to making a system by which cars can find parking spots that are usually avaialable using a given dataset. It will do this by taking into account all data for a given parking spot ID, whether that spot is available or not, what times it is usually available, etc. This is done for all parking spots and analysis will be made optimising to try and find peak days, times (possibily), and years via time-based partitioning.

The User groups for this would be drivers, parking administrators, and system operators.
