# Smart City Parking Optimization Database

This project is a design for a database system by which cars can find parking spots that are historically more likely to be available at given times. It will do this by taking into account historical data for a given parking spot including reservations, parking times, and usage patterns. This allows for further analysis, including peak hours, high-demand days, seasonal trends, and long-term usage behavior. 

The database supports both operational functionality (for example, reservations and parking events) and analytical functionality (for example, identifying peak congestion periods and frequently available spots).

The user groups for this would be drivers looking for a parking spot, parking administrators looking to monitor lot capacity and manage parking infrastructure, and system operators looking at their sensors..
